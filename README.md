# Zee-Recommender-Systems

**Problem Statement**

Create a Recommender System to show personalized movie recommendations based on ratings
given by a user and other users similar to them in order to improve user experience

 **Actionable Insights**
 
• Ratings are provided mostly by men.

• Users are usually generous as mostly they have provided ratings between 3-4.

• Rating 1-2 have been given very few times.

• Users watch movies usually between 12 am to 2 am.

• Less traffic is on the website during 11-5 i.e Corporate hours.

• Mostly rating are presented between October, November , December.

• There is a high rise in the movies released in 1990’s.

• People of Age 25 and 35 give highest number of ratings, whereas people over 45 hardly rate.

• College students are highly active on the platform.

• Farmers, retired and Craftsmen are the few professions which do not use the Platform alot.

• There is no difference between the mean rating of Male vs Female.

• Most movies belong to Comedy and Drama.

• Performed Recommender System using Cosine Similarity with respect to Item and User.

• Performed Recommender System using Pearson Correlation.

• Observed that the pivot for user vs matrix vs rating will be very sparse. Only 5 percent data is present.

• Performed Matrix Factorizations for recommending.

 **Recommendations**
 
1. Zee should encourage users to provide more ratings, espcially women.
2. Recommender systems based on users and item work well with zee.
3. Due to the sparse pivot , between users and items and ratings , Matrrix Factorizations should
be used.
4. Regression recommender systems can also be used. They can be more effective.
5. More Comedy and Drama should be recommended.
